# COVID-19-Website
## OECD Berlin would like us to make a website that people can use to find resources relevant to specific communities and donate to help people affected by the current COVID-19 crisis.
### Find explanations of the specific tasks that we'll work on in this shared Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vGilC57p1Cl7k152ps0bf5Dl-jFTLBaw?usp=sharing

## Week 2
Part 1 of this week's tasks is to create a template for the resource pages that we can easily use once we get OECD Berlin's Excel spreadsheet of resources. Be sure to include a name, brief description, location, and URL for each resource.
*If you have time, create a feature to add and remove resources from the database.

Part 2 of this week's tasks involves contacting LepotSolidaire to process the transactions for donations collected on this website. We want to ask how they can pass the data from their website back to ours, so we can add data visualizations of the donation amounts on the website.

Part 3 of this week's tasks is creating an admin login with a feature to add or remove a category tile from the homepage and making the overall website design more consistent with OECD Berlin's (https://www.oecd.org/berlin). Pay particular attention to the colors that they use (mainly blue), header style, fonts, and general appearance of the website.


### Week 1
Part 1 of Week 1's task is to create the homepage for our website. It should have a tile format for each category of resources. Explore this website as an example of nicely stylized tile integration: https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en

Part 2 of Week 1's task is to find a company that can process our transactions when people donate through the website that we create.

### Be sure to upload your Week 1 progress by THIS SATURDAY, April 25.

Part 2 (Donation Processing Company Task) should upload a document with their findings to our *Google Drive*
