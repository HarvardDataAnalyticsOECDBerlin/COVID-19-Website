# COVID-19-Website
## OECD Berlin would like us to make a website that people can use to find resources relevant to specific communities and donate to help people affected by the current COVID-19 crisis.
### Find explanations of the specific tasks that we'll work on in this shared Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vGilC57p1Cl7k152ps0bf5Dl-jFTLBaw?usp=sharing
Part 1 of Week 1's task is to create the homepage for our website. It should have a tile format for each category of resources. Explore this website as an example of nicely stylized tile integration: https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en

Part 2 of Week 1's task is to find a company that can process our transactions when people donate through the website that we create.

### Be sure to upload your Week 1 progress by THIS SATURDAY, April 25.
Part 1 (Homepage Task) should upload their code to this *Github*

Part 2 (Donation Processing Company Task) should upload a document with their findings to our *Google Drive*
